# Collective Shop

Collective shop is website where you would upload products that you wish to be sold, and as a user on the website be able to scour the site for products uploaded by othe users.

## UX

This website would be generally for anybody who has a product to sell, and would like to do easily. The main point of the project would be to make payments automated and deliver shipment details to the right person while having a legal backup doing so. 

The process itself would look like:
1. Make an account on the website via the 'Sign In' button the navigation bar.
2. Register a product which you would like to be sold by clicking your username in the navigation bar and pressing 'Add Item', then just fill out the form.
3. Another user finds your product in the shop (Shop button in navigation bar) and purchases it, adding to cart and pressing the 'checkout' button in the navigation bar.
4. Majority of the payment goes directly to you via direct transfer, small service fee is kept by company.
5. Shipment details is sent to the seller.
6. A digital contract would be signed when uploading a product to ensure that the buyer recieves it.

Not working to upload data from form to Django DB, tried googling and implementing all fixes I could find but nothing works, wrote to tutor support

Bug that occurs when adding more than 1 product to database, if you remove one of the items from profile page it gives you an 404 error.

A lot of help from the Code Institute tutor support. Aswell as a lot of googling.

Market type of website where you can upload products and purchase other users uploaded products.
Vision of payment would be to take a percentage of the payments for services, rest of payment goes to seller.

Shipment details would be sent to the seller to ship products themselves to the buyer.
Obviously a lot of security would be going in to this if it were to be a real site.

Such as signing contracts whenever a purchase is made so that you can't bail on the responsibility to send the product.
Basically a proof of concept site.
